##About Me

My name is Austin Adams and I am a Software Engineer. I have at least 10 years of experience creating amazing software for both man and machine. I'm people oriented, fast learning and excited to challenge tough problems with modern solutions. As a contributor sometimes and an overseer other times I know how to to lead and follow with wisdom in a team setting. I enjoy all aspects of the development process and because of that I know how to see a project through all stages of execution. I love teams, working together and pulling out the best in people. Modern software solutions are my preference but I can often be found looking into the past for guidance. I love to have fun, be with family and work in the community. I'm a family man with dreams to have a mini farm and create a sustainable living environment.

##What I’ve worked on##
In a general sense I have focused all my energy into the web. I have been architecting, building, maintaining, scaling and enhancing web applications for 10 years. Some of the most notable production applications are as follows:

####**bethel.tv** - [Link][1] 
E Commerce media delivery application with $MM revenue. I was a lead developer and created/maintained almost every part of the application and its services post 2013. 

Responsive TDD Angular.js, Horizontally scaled PHP stack, PubNub, Firebase, AWS

####**my.bssm.net** - [Link][2] 
LMS System powering ministry schools across the globe. I functioned as a support and integration engineer. I created data migration services from the previous version of the application (LAMP stack) into the new version (Rails Stack).

Rails, Redis, Digital Ocean

####**ecourses.bethel.tv** - [Link][3]
A separate bethel.tv product. An incredibly successful LMS system with progress tracking. Working as a team I provided backend api design architecture and client side MVC application engineering.

####**Bethel.tv Player V2** - Source code snippets available upon request.
Ground up re creation of bethel.tv's most critical product, the player. I architected, documented, built, tested a Angular 2 event driven wrapper on top of ThePlatform's(Comcast Company) PDK video playback engine.

##What I’m looking to do next##
I'm looking to join a team that encourages a healthy work/life balance while maintaining a high emphasis on excellent engineering with test driven development. I want to work for a company that provides great benefits and strives to create a great office culture or team family culture. I'm hoping to contribute to open source projects as a part of my job description. My aim is to team up with an employer that encourages self betterment and continuing education. I know a lot of things, and am really good at a lot of things, but there is still so much I want to learn. Things like concurrency, machine learning, big data science and disposable micro services are on my learning wish list. 
While I am happy to jump into any tech stack I would love to work more with the following technologies (In no particular order).

 - Haskell
 - Node.js
 - Go
 - Scala + Akka
 - Elixir, Phoenix
 - Rust
 - Hadoop
 - Kafka
 - Angular 2
 - NativeScript
 - React Native
 - Rxjs
